* Version Control Systems

** Version control system


A _tool_ for maintaining a _record of changes_ in a _set of documents_

- e.g. CVS, Subversion, Git, Darcs, Mercurial

- Good for managing
  - source code
  - documentation
  - scripts
  - Makefiles
  - other text files

- Can track binary files, but cannot view changes "line by line"
# because there are no "lines" in a binary file

** Reasons to use version control

- Helps collaboration
- Can roll back mistakes
- Can maintain different configurations

** Reasons to not use version control

** Reason to use version control for everything you do

- You find a set of files like this on your hard drive:
  
#+begin_example
Report_draft.txt
Report.doc
Report2.doc
Report2a.doc
Report_2011_03_02.doc
...
NewReport_2011_05.doc
NewReport_submitted.doc
NewReport_submittedv2.doc
#+end_example

# discuss centralized vs distributed later, during multi-user workflow

* Git

** About Git

- Most widely used distributed version control system
- Started by Linus Torvalds to support Linux kernel development
- Borrows from Unix philosophy:
  - collection of programs and scripts that can be chained together
  - flexibility lets it support different workflows

- Each VC system has its own terminology, but similar basic concepts
  - Our discussion will use established Git terms

** Sources for information

- Quick to learn the basic commands
- Commands not used every day, hard to remember, but many places
  to refresh memory:

  - [[http://book.git-scm.com/index.html][The Pro Git Book]]
  - Google for ``git cheat sheet''

- Other topics in this lesson covered by and taken from others:

  - [[http://marklodato.github.com/visual-git-guide/index-en.html][A Visual Git Reference]]
  - [[http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/][Git for Computer Scientists]]
  - [[http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/][A successful Git branching model]]

* Repositories

** Repositories in general

- A repository is a collection of *timelines*
- Each timeline is a series of *versions*
- Each version builds off the one(s) before it
- Timelines can *diverge* or *converge*
- In Git terminology,
  - a version is a *commit*
  - a divergence is a *branch*
  - a convergence is a *merge*

# picture: several timelines, including a branch and merge
   
** Git objects: commits

- A commit is a type of Git *object*
  - Git stores a "database" of objects as a collection of files
  - Each object is identified by the SHA1 hash of its contents
- Each commit
  - has a time, author, and log message
  - may reference zero (if root), one, or more (if a merge) parent commits
  - references a *tree* (by its SHA1 hash)
  
# picture of commit internal structure


** Git objects: trees
   
- A tree is another type of object
- Think of it as a snapshot of an entire directory
- Each tree associates names with files and subdirectories
  - That is, it maps strings to SHA1 hashes

# picture of tree internal structure

** Git objects: blobs
   
- Files in Git are stored as *blob* objects
- Each blob holds the entire contents of a file
  - If two versions of a file are similar, then it can be cheaper to
    replace one version with the list of differences, or *delta*,
    between the two versions
  - Some VC systems store deltas for every file
  - Git only periodically packs objects using deltas

    
** Git objects all together
   
- A commit references a tree which recursively holds a snapshot of
  every file in the project

# picture of commit pointing to tree pointing to blobs
   

** Shared objects
   
- Commits will share objects that have not changed between them
  
# picture of two trees with shared blobs
   
# picture of two commits with shared trees (only log message, parent different)
